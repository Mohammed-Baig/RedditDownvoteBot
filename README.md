# RedditDownvoteBot
A program that would ideally allow the user to downvote a post as many times as they want. Still very rough and a WIP but in its current state does perform its delegated task
Hello, this is a project I intended to work on over my grade 12 summer. Obviously in its current state it is quite rough but performs its tasks nonetheless. I have posted this
here to sort of "show off" my work and raise discussion amongst anyone with a similar interest; to create a forum where we can discuss ways of improving upon this design. As of
its current state to take full advantage you'll need an AntiCaptcha account, the reddit sitekey, the link of the post you want to upvote, and the class ID of the opvote/downvote
button you want the program to press, the latter 3 being able to be found through inspect element. In time I will make improvements and maybe even post tutorial vidoes on how to 
use and my progress. Thank you for reading and take care all!
